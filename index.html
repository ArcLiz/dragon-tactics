                <h2>Who, What and Why?</h2>
                <p>Welcome, I am so very glad that you've found your way to my corner of the world wide web.
                    My name is Seraphina Goldenstone and I am the Founder and CEO of <strong>Dragon Tactics</strong>, a
                    limited liability company dedicated to helping individuals across the globe with training their
                    dragons
                    and increasing their own education and knowledge about the magical creatures.</p>
                <div class="vertical-break"></div>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Ever since I was a child, I've been drawn to magical creatures. Dragons, unicorns, phoenixes. I loved
                    them all. There were many times where my mother had to look for me high and low, in the forest, in a
                    pile of books.. I would be searching for the creatures anywhere I could. After a while, I admitted
                    to
                    myself that it would be very difficult to get a hold of any of these creatures, so instead I
                    surrounded
                    myself with furry pets. I worked my way from hamsters to cats and lastly up to dogs, and when I got
                    my
                    first dog I realized my love of training animals to harness both their mental and physical
                    capabilities.
                </p>
                <div class="vertical-break"></div>
                <h3>Life Calling</h3>
                <p>When raising and training dogs became as easy as breathing, I knew that I needed a change.
                    So I started educating myself in the art of dragon training. I began learning from movies and books,
                    but
                    after a while I did some <em>big logic brain magicz and made logicz assumptions.</em> </p>
                <p>My logic went like this: A dragon flies and is the same size as a small plane, so he/she/it/they
                    should
                    need to adhere to regular air and flight protocols. The same goes with their fire or frost breath,
                    weather controlling capabilities etc. So, I just studied all those things via wikipedia and voil√°,
                    all-knowing in the art of dragon training, maintenance and regulation I became!</p>
                <div class="vertical-break"></div>
                <h3>Official Education</h3>
                <p>Aside from the varius courses and online self teaching I have undertaken, I am also certified as a
                    dragon
                    trainer, from Happily Never After College. You can find a copy of my certification <a
