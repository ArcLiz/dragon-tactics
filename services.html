            <h2>We're hiring!</h2>
            <p>I am always looking for new talent to join me in the field of dragon training.</p>

            <p>If you're feeling what I was feeling and you're sick and tired of the mundane desk job you're stuck
                in,
                and you're looking for a challenging and exciting job working where you will be at the top of your
                field,
                I highly recommend that you take the chance to join me here at <strong>Dragon Tactics.</strong></p>

            <p>Being a dragon trainer isn't as easy as the DreamWorks film makes it out to be though.
                There are real challenges to the profession. I'm looking for level headed individuals with a
                daredevil
                attitude.
                As you'll be putting yourself in close contact with mighty and yes, deadly, beasts, these are
                required
                attributes.
                Aside from the obvious challenges with the dragons strength and might, there are a few difficulties
                in
                regards to the society
                and as I want you to be aware of all sides before making the big step of a possible career change,
                I feel it is my duty as community leader to disclose some of the main challenges of being a dragon
                trainer in the 21st century.

            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty gaining experience in the field.<br><em>Due to the fact that dragons are mythological
                        creatures, they seem to be extremely hard to come by, therefore it can be difficult to put
                        your
                        knowledge on dragon training to practical use.</em></li>
                <li>Few job opportunities.<br><em>Due to the fact that dragons are mythological creatures, there
                        arenâ€™t
                        (m)any people looking for help in training their dragons or increasing their knowledge in
                        dragon
                        related law.</em></li>
                <li>Low credibility rating.<br><em>Due to the fact that dragons are mythological creatures, very few
                        people seem capable of taking the dragon trainer profession seriously.</em></li>
