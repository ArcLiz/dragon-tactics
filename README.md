## Introduction
---
Dragon Tactics is a site made to present and advertise Seraphina Goldenstone and the LLC Dragon Tactics.<br>
The site is created to provide relevant information to users about what the company is, the services the company offers as well as how to get in touch with the company.

The website is comprised of the following sections:<br>

1. Home/About
2. Services
3. Contact Page

From the companys standpoint, the goals with the website are:
1. To reach more individuals with their company than what their old "word of mouth" strategy generated
2. To generate interest in dragon training and Dragon Tactics services
3. To provide a simple way of prospective clients or hires to contact them

From a user standpoint, the goals with the website are:
1. As a first time visitor, I want to find easy-to-read information about dragon training
2. As a first time visitor, I want to know what Dragon Tactics can offer me
3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to contact Dragon Tactics

## UX

### **Strategy**
Due to the nature of the field, the company has met opposition in their past, which proved challenging in the initial planning phase of the project. 
Considering the lack of dragon believers in the world, individuals tend to doubt the legitimacy of the company and their services.
After speaking closely with Seraphina, we decided to address these problems with very specific site content, in addition to run of the mill company information and tables of services provided.
1. Link to a certificate, proving Seraphinas personal qualifications
2. Ability for users to contact Seraphina with doubts and questions
3. References to socially accepted theories and teachings
4. Media and images of dragons, Seraphina and dragon training to further cement the legitimacy of the work.

When deciding on features, design and technologies to use in the project, I first settled on the target user being:
- Aged 10-35
- Fantasy/Mythology interested
- Open minded

Much research into the specified target group resulted in narrowing down what these users would need to:
- Clean, modern and inspiring design
- Relevant and easily understood information
- Social Media links for follow up information
- Clear explanations and error fallbacks, in case of user-errors.

### **Scope**
After taking all of the above into account, we settled on the following features for the site:
- Header with a navigation menu for easy access to each page of the site
- Details about Seraphina and Dragon Tactics divided into easily managable sections of information
- Self Portrait of Seraphina
- Download link to Seraphinas official Dragon Trainer Certificate
- Easy-to-Read Table of the company's most popular courses on offer
- Fail proof contact form for users to connect with Seraphina/Dragon Tactics

### **Structure**
As a younger target group tends to shy away from too much information in one go, the site is divided into 3 different pages.

- **About/Home**,<br> containing information about Seraphina and the company's history, along with a list of skills and certifications.
- **Services**,<br> containing a table of the most popular courses on offer, along with additional access to their full list of services.
- **Contact**,<br> containing a contact form with required information to ensure that connection is made and can be replied to.

### **Skeleton**
[Wireframes](docs/wireframes.pdf)

I created very rough wireframes for the project which ended up not being followed exactly.<br>
At project inception, the idea was to have the landing page be a simple hero image page with just the navbar and footer.<br>
This idea was reworked and the landing page and the about page was merged into one, this to make the site easier to navigate and understand.<br>
The original wireframes also included a "Recruitment" page, which was later merged into the "Services" page as a design choice, as both Seraphina and myself liked the look of a 3-item navigation menu better.

### **Design**
For many, the thought of dragons bring thoughts of fire and destruction, which would have made a dark and red color theme the obvious choice. However, as we wanted to go for a *clean, modern and inspiring design*, we instead decided on a cold and frosty feeling instead. This was achieved with shades of icy blues and clean simplistic fonts through out the design.<br>
<br>
The font choices was made by doing a google search for fonts that pair well. However, I found no suggested pairing that suited my tastes, so I made my own combination of *Unica One* for headings and *Lato* for all bread text.

## Features

### Global Features
Nav, Footer
### Home page Features
About Skills

### Future Enhancements
Making the Contact Form actually e-mail Seraphina
I'd like to further cement the sarcastic "she's totally bonkers"-vibe by taking pictures of myself or other people training dogs etc, and photoshop them in an incredibly obvious way as a gallery feature showing off "her experience in dragon training"
